Lost in Translation

Typography & Interaction â€“ Project 4: Links

Original channel owner:

About project:
We created Aren.na boards for a topic of our linking, and then swapped topics with a random classmate. We designed our websites around the topic of their choice. Challanging, but fun!

About topic:
This project celebrates untranslatable words from various languages, each carrying profound meanings, emotions, and nuances that elude translation into English. Inspired by the movie Lost in Translation, the project uses visual media to help convey these words, creating a space where people can connect with and understand the depth that transcends linguistic boundaries.
